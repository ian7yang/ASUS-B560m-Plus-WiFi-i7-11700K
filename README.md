# ASUS-B560m-Plus-WiFi-i7-11700K

This is based on OC v0.8.0. You need to fill in the SMBIOS info before use.

Get the SMBIOS from here https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS.

## My Setup
| Component | Model |
|----|----|
| CPU | Intel i7-11700k (Faked CPUID to i7-10700K)|
| Motherboard | ASUS B560m Plus WiFi (iGPU disabled)| 
| WiFi/BlueTooth | Fenvi T919 (if you need handoff and AirDrop) |
| Graphic Card | Sapphire RX 580 |
| Memory | 4x8GB Ballitix@3200MHz |
| Storage | Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 SSD 2TB |



These cost me ~$800. It's a decent Hackintosh and more powerful than a Mac-mini.
It's been running smoothly since I created this repo.
